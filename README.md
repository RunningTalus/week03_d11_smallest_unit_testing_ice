Unit Testing: first

1) Create a new web app with yo refactoru-html
Say yes to main.js

2) Copy the assert function from the slides into a new file called smallest-unit-testing.js

3) Include smallest-unit-testing.js in a script tag in your html file.

4) Write a unit test, consisting of several assert statements in a new file called test.js, for the following function:

first: Takes an array and a number n, and returns a new array consisting of the first n elements of that array. e.g. first(['a','b','c'], 2) should return ['a','b']

Do not implement the first function! Just define an empty function called first and write the unit test.

5) Include test.js in your html file. Open index.html in your browser, and see your unit tests fail.
